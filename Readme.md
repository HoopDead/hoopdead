<h1 align = "center">Hello There 👋, my name is Mateusz and it is my pleasure to meet you here!</h1>

<h3> About me </h3>
<p>🧔🏻 Young programmer with a lot of willingness to work and fervor to face new challenges. Student at the University of Wrocław, physics, and astronomy facility, applied computer science. Right now interested in high-level programming languages - Python and JavaScript. My first line of code was written in 2016 when I had to create a quiz in PHP for my computer science classes in middle school. Then I started high school with an extended curriculum of math, computer science, physics, and English. That is where I learned basics algorithms, C++ and how does the network work. In meanwhile I played a lot of Minecraft and got interested in how does modifications and plugins works in this game so I took a part in developing my very first project - website snippet for Minecraft plugin, where users could do some things without even entering the game! My highschool time was also pretty productive - I participated twice in Hackathon conquest in Wałbrzych as a Front-End Developer. Highschool time ended and University started, the time where I learned the most and just after six months find a job as a Full-stack Trainee developing things in Python, Django, Javascript, React.</p>
